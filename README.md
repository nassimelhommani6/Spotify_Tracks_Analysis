# Spotify Tracks Analysis


This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Spotify tracks over 125 different genres. The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle, and the project consists of three parts where SQL, Power BI, Talend Open Studio, Excel, and SPSS were used.The project was divided into three parts, with each part focusing on a different aspect of data engineering, data analytics, and data science.

Part 1 - Data Engineering:

In the first part, the team created a pipeline using Talend Open Studio to retrieve playlist data from Spotify's web API. Then ,API calls were scheduled to get weekly updates for the released radar chart done in Power BI.

Part 2 - Data Analytics:
In the second part, data analytics were performed to answer questions about music genres:
- How long are music genres typically?
- How does a genre typically sound?
- Do characteristics of popular songs vary across genres?

Part 3 - Data Science:
In the third part,SPSS was used to predict the popularity of a track by answering the following questions:
- Which features are important?
- What is the correlation of audio characteristics?
- Which model is best suited for this?

This project provided valuable insights into music genres and track popularity. The use of various tools and techniques allowed for comprehensive analysis of the dataset, highlighting potential applications in building recommendation systems and classification purposes.
